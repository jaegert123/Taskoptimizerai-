If GoDaddy does not allow the @ symbol, leave it blank or enter your domain name (TaskOptimizerAI.com).

1Ô∏è‚É£ Enter the values as shown above.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Save the records in GoDaddy.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Let me know once saved, so I can verify everything for you.

ChatGPT said:

Awesome! üöÄ Now, TaskOptimizerAI.com should start propagating across the internet. This can take a few minutes to a few hours (up to 24 hours in rare cases), but usually, it's much faster.

‚úÖ Next Steps:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Wait for DNS Propagation ‚Äì Your domain should be live soon.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Test Your Website ‚Äì Try opening TaskOptimizerAI.com in a browser.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Let Me Know ‚Äì If the site isn‚Äôt working after some time, I can check for any issues.

You said:
What should the tag be for type a 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
For the A Record in GoDaddy, the Tag field is not required for a standard website setup. If GoDaddy forces you to enter a value, try the following:

Leave the Tag field blank (if allowed)
If a value is required, select default or None
Some registrars allow 0 or 1 as a placeholder
Final A Record Settings (GoDaddy)
Type	Host/Name	Points To (IP Address)	TTL	Tag
A	@ (or leave blank)	76.76.21.21	1 Hour	None / 0 (if required)
Try updating it with no tag, and if GoDaddy forces a value, enter 0 or None.

Let me know if you need further assistance! üöÄ






You said:
The options are issue issuewild and iodef 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
In GoDaddy's DNS settings, the Tag field is related to CAA (Certification Authority Authorization) records, which control SSL certificate issuance. For an A Record, you do NOT need to set a Tag.

What to Do?
If GoDaddy is asking for Tag options (issue, issuewild, iodef) for an A Record, you are likely in the wrong section (CAA settings instead of A Record).
Go back to the A Record section and make sure you're editing the correct field.
The A Record should NOT require a Tag‚Äîit only needs:
Host: @ (or leave blank)
Points to: 76.76.21.21
TTL: 1 Hour
If You're Still Seeing "Tag" in the A Record
Check if you are in the CAA section instead of A Record.
If GoDaddy is forcing a choice and you can‚Äôt proceed:
Try selecting "None" or leaving it blank.
If that doesn't work, you might need to delete any incorrect CAA records and only update the A Record.
Final Steps
‚úÖ Make sure you're in the A Record section, not CAA.
‚úÖ Enter the correct A Record values without a Tag.
‚úÖ Save and wait for DNS propagation.
